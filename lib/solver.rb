    #   a maximum matching M (a subset of the edges in E),
    # a minim vertex cover K can be constructed via the following technique:
    #
    # Let S' be the (possible empty) set of students in S not connected by M
    # Define an alterating path as a path that alternates between
    #   edges in M and those not in M (doesn't matter which you start on)
    # Let S* be the set of students in S that are either in S', or can
    #   be reached by following an alternating path from S' (a superset of S')
    # Let C* be the set of companies in C that can be reached by such a path from S'
    # Then the MVC K can be defined as the union of students not in S* and companies in C*
    #
    # More formally:
    # S' = { s in S not connected by M }
    # S* = S' U { s in S reachable by an alternating path from S' }
